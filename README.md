# CNN For Image Classification
Here we have the code for a convolutional neural network built using tensoflow that has been trained to classify images of living and non living things.

### Instructions to run code:
Once you download the notebook open the .ipynb file in google collaborate. It is convinient to do so in Google Collab because the tensorflow library comes with google collab and you will not have to download it. If you do have tensorflow downloaded then you can run the code in Jupyter Notebook or any other editor of your choice.
